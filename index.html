          <img src="img/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is David Alade" width="200">
          <p>My name is David Alade and I am in Abuja, Nigeria. I enjoy playing football, playing video games, music, Am a student of BYU, Idaho. I hope to be a full stack (frontend and backend web developer), owning my own company across the global; and i desire to be offered partneship by Apple In'tl, Microsoft, Tesla, and countries across the globe. My favourite scriptures are as follows: Micah 3:8 which says 'But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.' Matt. 6:33 which says ' But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.' Rom 8:28-38 whcih says 'And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come and so on.</p>
