          What is Water Rafting?

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>White-water rafting is an outdoor adventure sport that involves navigating through turbulent river waters using inflatable rafts. The term "white-water" refers to the frothy appearance of water as it flows over rocks and rapids, creating a challenging and exciting environment.

            Rafting trips can vary in intensity, categorized into classes based on the difficulty of the rapids, ranging from calm waters suitable for beginners to highly challenging sections requiring advanced skills. Participants work together to paddle and steer the raft through the rapids, and safety gear like life jackets and helmets is typically provided.
            
            The experience often combines physical exertion with the thrill of navigating swift currents and is popular in scenic locations with rivers. Guided tours are common, especially for those new to the sport, ensuring safety and maximizing enjoyment.</p>

          <p>
            Class I (Easy): Calm waters with small waves; perfect for beginners. No skill is required, and a pleasant float can be enjoyed.<br>

            Class II (Novice): Slightly more challenging with small waves and some maneuvering needed. Suitable for novice paddlers; basic skills may be helpful.<br>
            
            Class III (Intermediate): Moderate rapids with larger waves, requiring good paddling skills and teamwork. Maneuvering around obstacles is essential.<br>
            
            Class IV (Advanced): Strong, powerful rapids with large waves and obstacles that require precise navigation and strong paddling skills. Experience is recommended.<br>
            
            Class V (Expert): Extremely challenging rapids with unpredictable conditions and very large waves. This class demands advanced skills and experience, and it's often recommended to go with an experienced guide.<br>
            
            Class VI (Extreme): These are considered unraftable under most conditions due to the extreme hazards involved. Only attempted by experts in very controlled situations.<br></p>

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Whether you need previous experience to go rafting depends on the class of rapids you plan to tackle.<br> 

            - Class I and II:** No previous experience is needed; these levels are suitable for beginners and families. Many outfitters offer guided trips for newcomers.<br>
            
            - Class III:** Some basic paddling skills are beneficial, but many guides provide instruction, making it accessible for those with little experience.<br>
            
            - Class IV and above:** Previous experience is highly recommended, especially for Class IV and V rapids, as they require more advanced skills and teamwork. It's often best to go with a professional guide if you're inexperienced in these conditions.<br>
            
            If you're unsure, it’s always a good idea to check with the rafting company, as they can recommend trips based on your experience level.<br></p>

          What should I wear for rafting?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>When preparing for a rafting trip, it’s important to wear appropriate clothing for comfort and safety. Here are some recommendations:

            Quick-Drying Clothing: Choose synthetic materials like polyester or nylon, which dry quickly. Avoid cotton, as it retains water and can make you cold.<br>
            
            Swimsuit: A swimsuit is a great base layer, especially in warm weather.<br>
            
            Footwear: Wear water shoes or sandals with straps that won’t come off easily. Avoid flip-flops, as they can be hazardous.<br>
            
            Layering: Depending on the weather, you might need layers. A lightweight, moisture-wicking shirt and a fleece or waterproof jacket can keep you warm.<br>
            
            Sun Protection: Don’t forget a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with a strap. Apply waterproof sunscreen to protect against sunburn.<br>
            
            Safety Gear: Most outfitters provide essential safety gear, such as life jackets and helmets. Make sure to wear them at all times during the trip.<br>
            
            Dry Bag: If you want to bring personal items (like a camera or snacks), use a waterproof dry bag to keep them safe and dry.<br>
            
            Dressing appropriately ensures you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience on the water!<br></p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>During a rafting trip, outfitters typically provide several essential safety equipment items to ensure participants’ safety. Common safety gear includes:<br>

            Life Jackets (PFDs): Personal flotation devices are mandatory and must be worn at all times on the water. They are designed to keep you afloat.<br>
            
            Helmets: Required for navigating rapids, helmets protect your head from potential impacts with rocks or other obstacles.<br>
            
            Paddles: Rafts come equipped with paddles for participants to help steer and propel the boat.<br>
            
            Safety Whistle: A whistle is often attached to your life jacket for signaling in emergencies.<br>
            
            Throw Bags: These bags contain a length of rope and are used for rescue situations, allowing you to throw a line to someone in the water.<br>
            
            First Aid Kit: Outfitters usually carry a first aid kit on the raft for treating minor injuries.<br>
            
            Communication Devices: Many guides have radios or other communication devices for emergencies.<br>
            
            Dry Bags: While not safety gear per se, these are often provided to keep your personal items dry.<br>

          What happens if someone falls out of the raft?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If someone falls out of the raft, here are the typical steps to follow:<br>

            1. Stay Calm**: It’s important for the person who fell out to remain as calm as possible to conserve energy and make rational decisions.<br>
            
            2. Feet First**: If possible, float on your back with your feet facing downstream. This helps keep your body in a safer position to navigate any obstacles.<br>
            
            3. Hold On**: If you’re near the raft, try to reach for it. Guides often extend paddles or ropes to help pull you back in.<br>
            
            4. Follow the Guide's Instructions**: The guide will provide directions. If they shout instructions, try to follow them closely.<br>
            
            5. Avoid Obstacles**: If you’re being swept downstream, try to avoid rocks, logs, or other hazards.<br>
            
            6. Get to Safety**: The guide will usually maneuver the raft to get back to the person who fell out. If you’re separated, you may be instructed to swim to a designated safe area.<br>
            
            7. Reboard the Raft**: Once back to the raft, the guide will assist with getting back in, ensuring that everyone is safe and accounted for.
            
            Most rafting companies have protocols in place for such situations, and guides are trained to handle falls effectively.<br></p>
